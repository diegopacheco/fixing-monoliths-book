, and my favorite debate club: architects community of practices and development groups
for more than a decade. Live, breathe, and practice real agile since 2005, coaching teams
have helped many companies to discover better ways to work using Lean, Agile principles and
methods like XP and DTA. I've led complex architecture teams and engineering teams at
scale guided by SOA principles, using a variety of open-source languages like Java, Scala,
Rust, Go, Python, Groovy, JavaScript, and TypeScript, cloud providers like AWS Cloud and
Google GCP, amazing solutions like Akka, ActiveMQ, Netty, Tomcat and Gatling, NoSQL
databases like Cassandra, Redis, Elasticache Redis, Elasticsearch, Opensearch, RabbitMQ,
libraries like Spring, Hibernate, and Spring Boot and also the NetflixOSS Stack: Simian
Army, RxJava, Karyon, Dynomite, Eureka, and Ribbon. I’ve implemented complex security
solutions at scale using AWS KMS, S3, Containers (ECS and EKs), Terraform, and Jenkins.
Over a decade of experience as a consultant, coding, designing, and training people at big
customers in Brazil, London, Barcelona, India, and the USA(Silicon Valley and Midwest).
I have a passion for functional programming and distributed systems, NoSQL Databases,
an obsession for Observability, and always learning new programming languages.
Currently working as a principal Software Architect with AWS public cloud, Kubernetes/
EKS, performing complex cloud migrations, library migrations, server and persistence
migrations, and security at scale with multi-level envelope encryption solutions using KMS
and S3. While still hiring, teaching, mentoring, and growing engineers and architects.
During my free time, I love playing with my daughter, playing guitar, gaming, coding
pocs, and blogging. http://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com.br/.
